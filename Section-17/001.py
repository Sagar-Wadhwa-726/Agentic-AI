# Prompt styles - how to give instructions to the LLM

"""This has been seen before : 


 messages=[
        {
            "role" : "system",
            "content" : SYSTEM_PROMPT
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hey There !"
        }
    ]

this can be used to distinguish who is who, what all prompots are being given by the user and what all prompts are being given to the system


The above format of prompt style is the widely used one.
